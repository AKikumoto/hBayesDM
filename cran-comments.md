## R CMD check results

There was no ERROR.

There were 2 WARNINGS:

* checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... WARNING
  Found the following file(s) containing GNU extensions:
    src/Makevars

  We're using the Makevars file generated by rstantools, which
  is completely fine to use as it is.
  
* checking compilation flags in Makevars ... WARNING
  Non-portable flags in variable 'PKG_CPPFLAGS':
    -Wno-ignored-attributes
    
  We use '-Wno-ignored-attributes' to ignore considerable amount of logs
  when using RcppEigen.

There were 2 NOTES:

* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
  no visible binding for global variable

  These messages are generated since hBayesDM use data.table.

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 26.7Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    extdata   1.2Mb
    libs     23.6Mb
    R         1.5Mb

  hBayesDM use compiled binaries for Stan models.

## Misc

Since hBayesDM takes about a hour for compilation, the timeout should be prolonged.
